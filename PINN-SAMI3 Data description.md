# The data description of the paper: A novel ionospheric inversion model: PINN-SAMI3(Physics Informed Neural Network based on SAMI3)
The raw data used in this study is based on the simulation data of the SAMI3 ionospheric full physical model. 
The data consists of two parts: (1) December 23, 2019 (Section 3.1~3.4); (2) November 4, 2021 (Section 3.5);
Because the data is too large, download it via the following link: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11_DH0nBjQ6YOa2V001bpJvli-u-xuCMj?usp=drive_link
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bMnqvdXWcVreIGRTdeGfCCLK_FQ6A_ct?usp=drive_link
The link contains two folders. Each folder contains a '.rar' package, which contains density data after decompression: (1) SAMI3_raw_data_20191223 (2) SAMI3_raw_data_20211104;
Each folder contains 7 files, the original files of ion density. 
Where data "deni1u.dat ~ deni7u.dat" represent the ion densities of H, O, NO, O2, He, N2 and N, respectively. The temporal resolution of the data is 8s.
The "SAMI3_raw_data_20191223" folder contains the seven files mentioned above. This set of data contains the ion density training data of 0-15min required in the paper. 
Similarly, the "SAMI3_raw_data_20211104" folder contains data from 0-15 minutes during the magnetic storm.
If you need the datasets mentioned in the paper (such as raw data on velocity, temperature, etc.), please contact me. It would be great if you could let me know how you plan to utilize this data.
